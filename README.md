# React Poker

### Introduction
A react UI that evaluates poker hands for between 2 and 6 players. Made for the Grabyo tech test.
As this is my first foray into a more complicated react front end, I started simple by refactoring some components and getting the simple functionality of adding and removing players. This enabled me to pick up how the state and props work and how data can be passed between parent and child components, and vice versa.
